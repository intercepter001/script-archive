<ul>
   <li><B>dir.scrap-bag-of-goodies</B>: a selection of copies of other people's scripts 
                                    and efforts to help out with android tasks as 
                                    found in my ~/bin directory.
   <p>
   <li><B>android.logcat</B> grabs logcat output via ssh and filters out some noise
   <li><B>android.twlauncher.decode</B> decodes the twlauncher database. Useful to
       match apk files with classes and topics if you keep your apps in topical directories 
       like networking, office, etc.
   <li><a href="http://github.com/jakobi/script-archive/tree/master/raw/android/android-setup-example-files.tgz"><B>android-setup-example-files.tgz</B></a> 
       is a one-time snapshot of a working
       android gingerbread setup for chroot and shell use (incl. a small collection
       of static armel binaries), plus configuration and files used
       for remote backup and monitoring. It is intended to illustrate the
       android section mentioned below.

<ul>
   <li>the <a href="/android-section/"><b>article series in the android section</b></a> about setting up a sane
       unix environment, a chroot, and some observations on privacy, security, and 
       assumptions seemingly made about and against users of modern smartphones. The
       above example files tarball contains the configuration, scripts, etc mentioned.
   <li><B>android.func</B> (dir.shell): shell functions, incl. ssh, scp, battery status
   <li><B>watch_delta</B> (cli.processes): a script to capture changes in command output. I use it with 
       arguments -netstatl -initial on the android to keep an eye on network connections.
       It basically runs the loop <i>netstat;sleep 1</i> (basically the unimplemented -c option in busybox), 
       augments the output and summarizes changes between netstat runs; optionally acquiring a wake_lock.
       It's not perfect as it may miss connections, but it still allows me to obtain an overview of 
       active connections. <i>Drop me a line if I break it again on android, as I mostly
       use it on proper Unix systems</i>.
