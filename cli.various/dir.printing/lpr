# BUG1 gtk printing as only option to print in firefox 3
# BUG2 without workarounds, storing previous printing options et al
# BUG3 ppid is 1
# BUG4 caller is not firefox
# BUG5 only option determining caller: 
#   a) pts/N or 
#   b) ADDON_PATH, LIBPRATH
# BUG6 is this idiotic workaround indeed assumed to be a 
#      modern superior way of printing suitable to clueless 
#      windows escapees?
# BUG7 out of vitriol error, requestion resupply in suitable
#              amounts for this class of lunacy
#
# really, the only proper way to cope would be deinstallation of
# anything gnome,gtk,firefox,mozilla for this kind of idiocy.
