<p>I  still  want to finish some macros and finally split my grab  bag
vim script file into presentable sections. Don't hold your breath.</p>

<ul>
   <li>shell scripts
      <ul> 
         <li>experimental: <b>vimscript</b> uses vim as interpreter for file containing
            non-interactive vim script. Can be used with pipes. Note that the
            script still requires a TTY due to short-comings of vim's head-less mode.
            For the time being, do <i>not</i> try to run multiple scripts in parallel; 
            the tempfile handling needs fixing (bash; full rewrite of the original vimsh 
            vimscript example). Published as 
            <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2768">vimscript#2768</a> ).
        <li><b>pipe.vim</b> aka <b>vimpipe</b>: interactively use vim within a pipe, 
            e.g. for <tt>grep|pipe.vim|Grep.xchange</tt>. It also allow end-of-pipe
            style uses like <tt>find|xargs pipe.vim</tt>, editing all files being 
            passed as arguments from xargs, with help and the contents of stdin 
            available in the last buffer. Note that both pipe.vim and vimless
            do <i>wait for the end of input</i> from earlier pipe stages. Published as 
            <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2769">vimscript#2769</a> .
        <li><b>pipe.vimcolorcat</b> is a small shell wrapper around the 2ansi / 2html macros
            for use as an intermediate non-interactive pipeline stage. Syntax-highlighing of
            output is done using either ANSI sequences or colored HTML according to the file
            type's vim syntax file. 2html.vim is part of the standard runtime, 2ansi.vim can 
            be found on vim.org as vim2ansi script. For the time being, do <i>not</i> run 
            pipe.vimcolorcat in parallel; shell-loops and similar are ok.
        <li><b>vimless</b> is similar to pipe.vim, but for the last stage of a pipe, slightly 
            preconfigured to implement a less-clone capable of syntax highlighting. Like pipe.vim, 
            it can also be wrapped by e.g. xargs. Simple vim options can also be placed in
            VIMLESSOPT, e.g. export VIMLESSOPT='-c "set ft=perl"' (note that the standard
            runtime contains a variant of this in form of macros/less.sh (macros/less.vim))
      </ul>
   <li>vim scripts
      <ul>
         <li>to be added: configuration files (dir.runtime)
         <li>to be added: vimsh with pty3 + urxvt patch (vimsh for interactive commands 
             and improved session subscripts)
         <li>to be added: vim scripts (after a clean up and split of .vimrc and 
             my function library file)
      </ul>
